# Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis Prediction

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict thyroid cancer diagnosis based on medical data.

## Description

The notebook `Thyroid_Cancer_Diagnosis_Prediction.ipynb` contains data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of machine learning models to assist in diagnosing thyroid cancer.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for better feature understanding.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Performance metrics visualization.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/thyroid-cancer-prediction.git
   cd thyroid-cancer-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `Thyroid_Cancer_Diagnosis_Prediction.ipynb` in your browser.

## Usage

- Load the dataset and explore the data.
- Preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers.
- Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine).
- Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize the results for better interpretation.

## Contributing
